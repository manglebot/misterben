# React + TypeScript + Vite

This site is my own personal site, Origionally built with just html, css and vanilla js, but rebuilt with React when I finally updated my skillset.

Installed with vite, it makes use of React Router and TypeScript along with BEM CSS.

## I plan to update the site with new features and content, and use it as my playground for learning.
