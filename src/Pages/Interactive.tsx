        Navigating Artistic Spaces: A Breakthrough Interactive Room Guide for

          OK, this was Donky's years ago (2008-9) back when Flash ruled
          interactive, but it's an example of me taking on a task and owning it.
          During my time at Tate for a prominent Francis Bacon exhibition, I was
          tasked with developing an interactive room guide using Flash. Working
          closely with a dedicated team, we seamlessly integrated multimedia
          elements like audio, video, photographs, and text, offering visitors
          an engaging and sophisticated journey into the world of Francis Bacon.

          Within a mere six weeks, I devoted myself to acquiring the necessary
          skills to design, construct, and create a sprawling interactive
          canvas. This canvas allowed users to navigate through various
          locations, each representing a distinct room. It was an incredibly
          enjoyable experience and proved to be a profound learning opportunity.
          Moreover, the resulting work became one of my most successful
          contributions at Tate. Regrettably, with the decline of Flash, its
          continued existence is no longer possible.
