          I have plenty of experience of designing promotional material for
          websites and emails, and some print related marketing materials.

          Below is my most recent work, with Quba & Co. I have worked with a
          number of fashion sites, including N Brown, and Arcadia Group. Often
          this work is rapid development where I'm given and image and some text
          and need something ready within an hour or two, which can be both
          challenging and rewarding.

      <h3>Marketing for a fashion company</h3>

      <p>
        I worked for Quba &amp; Co for 6 months creating new marketing
        materials.

        It was fun change from some companies as they initially didn't show me
        any previous work (aside from what I'd seen on their website). They
        asked me to come up with fresh ideas, but with the aim of having as many
        ideas as possible without getting too attached to any one concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my simplest but most popular ideas was combining text and numbers
        for a 50 for 50% sale.

        <img
          className="inner-page__image"
          src="/images/quba_50for50.png"
          alt="Quba - Fifty for 50"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Here you can see it within an email, along with the closing tonight
        label added.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          className="inner-page__image"
          src="/images/quba_50for50-screenshot.png"
          alt="Quba - Fifty for 50 - ends tonight"
        />
      </p>

      <p>This inspired other email campaigns including a knitting one.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          className="inner-page__image"
          src="/images/quba_knitwear.png"
          alt="Quba - knitwear promo"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        I also made campaigns inspired by some of their clothes designs. Here
        using the company's logo colour scheme to inspire the design, along with
        the numbers sewn in, a feature which appears in many of their clothes,
        which itself is inspired by the numbers on sail boats. The map in the
        background was also created from a map that appears on the clothes label
        tag.

        />
      </p>

      <p>It was also reused with different colour schemes</p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        For easter we ran a whole campaign using an egg (playing on the sound of
        "X") theme, here the final day shows a golden egg that I had fun
        animating.
