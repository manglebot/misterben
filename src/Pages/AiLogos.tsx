          As a dedicated web designer, I have spent years refining my skills in
          creating visually captivating websites. My expertise lies in design,
          complemented by a working knowledge of coding, which allows me to
          bring my designs to life.

        <p>
          Throughout my web design career, I have had the opportunity to work on
          various exciting projects. One notable example is my work with B'Spoke
          Coffee, where I successfully developed an e-commerce site, overseeing
          the design and implementation process.

          Just for fun, I've been playing at seeing what logos I can create with
          the help of AI.

          Some of these have very specific instructions, others more open, but
          I'm enjoying the process of getting the technology to show me so many
          ideas.
