    content: `## I started building websites in 1997.\n\nI was lucky to start my career at Arcadia Group, creating fashion pages for TopMan, TopShop, Racing Green, Burton, and several other sites. At this time, websites were very simple. No CSS, just basic HTML and a sprinkling of JavaScript. This started a 15-year streak of building and designing websites. In the very early days, I was always expected to do both, but after going freelance I found there were many jobs in website development. Highlights include Ministry of Sound - my first freelance job, where I was brought in to code pages and fix JavaScript errors, and Syzygy Agency who I worked for over a period of 2 years on many projects including front end page building on sites like Mazda, Mercedes, Jewsons, Boots (TV site), up to senior front end developer (overseeing a team of junior developers) on Curry's and The Link websites.\n\n![Logo's of companies I worked for](/assets/images/early_companies.jpg)\n\nNot long after Syzygy, I got a full-time position at the Tate Gallery, with primary responsibility for Tate Modern branch of the site. I would design and build bespoke websites for every major exhibition, and quite often for the smaller gallery at Tate Modern, where I would have more creative freedom, sometimes meeting the artist in question to see what they wanted for their online presence - often using this for my more experimental bits of coding.![Tate Britain Francis Bacon interactive](/assets/images/tate_bacon_interactives.jpg)\n\nThe biggest two projects I did for Tate were an interactive exhibition guide for Francis Bacon website, and an even more dynamic website that explored the work and life of Naum Gabo. There is a page here about the Francis Bacon exhibition. I had to learn enough ActionScript (which I barely knew at the time), in order to create a site that would be visited by many thousands of people and therefore had to work perfectly, which thankfully it did, and I had amazing feedback on.\n\nMore recently, I learnt WordPress in my own time, and have created a number of sites with this, including 3 sites for B'spoke Coffee House, which included a WooCommerce site. I knew nothing of how to implement this, but after doing research managed to create a site for the client on a very limited budget, which was both aesthetically pleasing, but financially viable. You can read more about it [here on my web design page](/pages/website). I'm not a PHP programmer, but have tweaked pages and pushed code around to do things I wanted.![B'spoke Coffee House websites](/assets/images/bspoke_websites.jpg)\n\nMost recently (Oct 23 - Jan 24), I completed a full stack Web Developer course from Tech Returners. This was a refresher course, which after my career break looking after my children, allowed me to get back in touch with the coding world, and re-learn both front end and back end website coding with JavaScript. It covered the most common requirements of today's code stack, including HTML, CSS (BEM, Tailwind), TypeScript, ES6, React, Node.js, TDD, MVC, Git, JSON, and more. I got to work both solo and in teams, and even learnt pair programming. It massively increased my confidence in coding and has reignited my desire to work again in the web development world.\n\n![Tech Returners Certificate](/assets/images/tech-returners-certificate.jpg)\n\nOh and I also built this site (the one you're looking at right now), originally in vanilla HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript, but now completely rebuilt as a React site, with React Router and BEM CSS.`,

My expertise lies in design, complemented by a working knowledge of coding, which allows me to bring my designs to life.\n\nThroughout my web design career, I have had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects. One notable example is my work with B'Spoke Coffee, where I successfully developed an e-commerce site, overseeing the design and implementation process. ## B'Spoke Coffee Redesign 2022 ### Three Unique Websites, One Designer\n\n B'Spoke Coffee's digital journey underwent three distinct phases, and I was at the helm of all three projects. The first iteration involved a cost-effective approach using an off-the-shelf free WordPress theme, which I tweaked and customized to establish a fully functional website and blogging platform for the new company.\n\n Original site:
    ![Screenshots of B'spoke's original website](/assets/images/bspoke_screenshots.jpg)\n\nFor the second special Christmas site, I drew inspiration from designer [Adi Wright](http://www.adiwright.co.uk)'s new logo for B'spoke and rough concept to create a distinctive and engaging site using WooCommerce within WordPress. Although it was my first time building a WooCommerce site, the result was a resounding success.\n\nAdi's Supplied concept below, along with a rough drawing from Nick at B'spoke\n\n![B'spokes xmas concepts](/assets/images/bspoke_concept_2019+drawing.jpg)Here is how it turned out (screenshot so not showing header or footer)\n\n![B'spoke Christmas website screenshot](/assets/images/bspoke_xmas.jpg)\n\nThe third site was a creative combination of the previous Christmas site, innovative design concepts from local artist Pip Claffay - [https://www.rune-creative.co.uk](https://www.rune-creative.co.uk), and my own contribution. The design drew inspiration from Pip's dripping graphic, which I transformed into a dynamic visual element. For a touch of fun and personality, I animated one of Pip's bicycle graphics using the GSAP javascript animation library, which reacts to users scrolling.\n\nWith WooCommerce as the backbone, I applied custom requests, such as free postage over &pound;25 (excluding subscriptions) and offered lessons on how B'Spoke could update the website themselves. The end result was a clean and functional shop interface that showcases their products effectively.\n\nB'Spoke Coffee love their website; you can check it out at [bspokecoffeehouse.co.uk](http://bspokecoffeehouse.co.uk).\n\nPip's concepts.\n\n![Rune Creative's B'spoke Coffee website concept](/assets/images/rune_concepts.png)\n\n![Rune Creative's header idea](/assets/images/rune_header_idea.png)\n\nEarly mockups.

One of my main tasks was to create a custom website for every exhibition. Usually following on from the print designs (website always came last!), I would create a design that complemented the print design along with creating room guides that allowed people to get a sneak preview or for people that couldn't get to the exhibition a chance to see what was on show.\n\nExamples shown here include the Duchamp, Man Ray Picabia exhibition where I managed to use the urinal holes as bullet points.\n\n![Screenshot of Duchamp, Man Ray, Picaba exhibition at Tate Modern](/assets/images/tate_duchamp.jpg)\n\nDoris Salcedo print artwork came in at an angle, so I created a website where nearly everything was slightly wonky.\n\n![Screenshot of Doris Salcedo exhibition at Tate Modern](/assets/images/tate_salcedo.jpg)\n\nStreet & Studio was a fairly minimal design with a simple blue strip that I carried through each page.\n\n![Screenshot of Street & Studio exhibition at Tate Modern](/assets/images/tate_street+studio1.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot of Street & Studio exhibition at Tate Modern](/assets/images/tate_street+studio2.jpg)\n\nI had more freedom (and less time) with Tate Modern's smaller exhibition space Level 2 Gallery, and got to create my own layouts, not following any existing print designs - so I would design sites inspired by the artwork on display. Here I used Nicholas Hlobo's beautiful patchworks as a colourful background with translucent text boxes.

During my time at Tate for a prominent Francis Bacon exhibition, I was tasked with developing an interactive room guide using Flash. Working closely with a dedicated team, we seamlessly integrated multimedia elements like audio, video, photographs, and text, offering visitors an engaging and sophisticated journey into the world of Francis Bacon.\n\nWithin a mere six weeks, I devoted myself to acquiring the necessary skills to design, construct, and create a sprawling interactive canvas. This canvas allowed users to navigate through various locations, each representing a distinct room. It was an incredibly enjoyable experience and proved to be a profound learning opportunity. Moreover, the resulting work became one of my most successful contributions at Tate.

I created a layout that allowed you to choose by subject or date or other category or everything and a wall of thumbnails would appear that you could click on to find more information.
